## About

Grammable is a web application for posting photos ("grams") and comments. Each gram has a caption, and users can post comments about the gram.

Grammable was created using Test-Driven Development (`TDD`).

## Getting Started

A user account is required in order to post grams and comment on grams.

A sample user account can also be signed into. The username is `gram@example.com`. The password and username match.
